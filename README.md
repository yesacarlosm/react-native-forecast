# react-native-forecast
### by carlos yesa.

This project was made with React native using react hooks.
As the time was short, and currently I'm on a macbook pro, I decided to compile the project just for iOS.
I implemented a state management like redux but made from scratch with the react hooks (createContext, useContext, useReducer). I think its really important to show how simple was the project and there was no need to add any state management libs. Most of the time we implement Redux, but, do we need it ?.


## Installed via npx react-native. Please use 'npx react-native run-ios/run-android' to run it.



Regards!
